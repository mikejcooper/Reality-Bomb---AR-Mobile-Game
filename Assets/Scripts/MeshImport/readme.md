# MeshImport

To load meshes during the game, go to the `dev_server~` directory. This is hidden in the Unity GUI, so you'll need to find it in your file manager / terminal. From there, run npm install to install the required Node JS modules and then `node app.js` to run the mesh server. Now when you run the game you should see a mesh get imported when it runs.
